          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Jus Guh Up Deh, a partnership between three individuals located in the cool hills of St.Andrew
                at 6 Gordon Town Road, is a hiking, camping and excursion tours company. Since the unofficial
                launch in 2012, we have been making strides within the hiking and camping niche.</br></br>

                The company was founded by Mr. Rockeem Anderson, who currently fills the role of Chief
                Executive Officer, and is managed jointly by Mr. Andre Harriot, Chief Operating Manager and
                Miss Kimberly Goode, Chief Financial Officer. There are currently five persons employed part-
                time as tour guides.</br></br>

                Partnering with the Tourism Product Development Company Limited (TPDco), Jamaica
                Conservation and Development Trust (JCDT) and Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT) we
                have assisted in the development of Jamaica’s Eco-Tourism product by creating interest in
                notable eco-tourism sites in Jamaica and bringing quality guided trips to locals and foreigners
                including school, church and business groups.</br></br>

                Jus Guh Up Deh is committed to having their clients experience Jamaican culture and heritage in
                a different way. Away from the hype of city and its nightlife and into the natural wonders of
                Jamaica’s scenic environment; its natural flora and fauna, and rustic outdoors, that makes it
                world- renowned and perfect for a weekend, vacation or overnight hideaway.</br></br>

                In the near future, we hope to expand our services to include other cultural and entertainment
                activities that are uniquely Jamaican.</br></br>

                Customers will like touring with Jus Guh Up Deh because the staff is friendly, courteous and
                provides a unique bonding experience that makes you are a part of the family. In addition, the
                tours not only focus on getting the client to the destination, but having meaningful experiences
                along the journey. </br></br>
